# Contribute to the project by adding other icons

***Attention I remind you that the icons must be in svg format***

If you like, you can help me expand the number of icons available. Just add to the variable  `var icons`

let's take the first string for example:

```js
"Bollard": [0, 0, 32.0, 32.0, "string"]
```
* `Bollard` = icon name

* `0, 0, 32.0, 32.0` = this data can be recovered from the svg file `transform="scale(0, 0, 32.0, 32.0)` ***If this data is not present in the file you can leave the one indicated by me***

* `String` = this data can be recovered from the svg file  `<path d="M21,12.5 C21,13.33 18.76,...."`
